Assessment of Default Deck Separation

Based on the inspection of the `public.default_flashcards` table in your Supabase project 'Levantini' (ID: mnfxcqpwvsprsrxmaxxt), it has been determined that the cards currently lack specific tags or categorization within the database schema that would allow for automatic separation into appropriate decks.

The `tags` column in the `default_flashcards` table appears to be empty, and there is no other readily available column to use as a criterion for grouping the cards into smaller, 주제별 decks.

To proceed with separating the 5400+ cards, the following approaches could be considered:

1.  **Manual Tagging:** Manually add tags to each card in the `default_flashcards` table based on their content (e.g., grammar, vocabulary, phrases, specific topics). This would require a significant manual effort due to the large number of cards.

2.  **External Data Source:** If you have an external source of data that contains categories or deck information for these cards, that data could be imported and used to update the `default_flashcards` table.

3.  **Content Analysis (Requires further development):** Develop a process to analyze the content of each card (English, Arabic, transliteration) to automatically assign tags or categories. This would likely involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques and would require significant development effort.

Without a clear method for categorization based on the existing data, automatic separation of the cards into meaningful decks is not possible at this time.

Please review this assessment and let me know how you would like to proceed.
